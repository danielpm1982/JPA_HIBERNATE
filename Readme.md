[**DESCRIPTION OF THIS REPOSITORY**]<br>
This Repository includes basic JAVA SE Console and JAVA EE Web JPA Projects. Must add the Hibernate framework jars, the JEE servlet/jsp/jstl jars (if web project) and MysqlConnectorJava jar to the classpath of the project for the code to run. Hibernate jars included. JAVA8+ compatible.

[**UPDATE FEB-2020**]<br>
This repository is a collection of FINISHED projects, with no .git commit history (for each project separately) and NOT subject to change or contributions. The purpose of this and of other similar "academics" repositories in my account has been merely to store finished projects in a cloud backup, not for continuous or shared development. In case you wanna follow, issue, fork or contribute with pull requests to UNDER DEVELOPMENT projects of mine, please look for the individual repo of each respective project in my account (https://github.com/danielpm1982?tab=repositories), instead of in these "academics" repos. From now on, when under development projects are finished, I'll keep copying them to "academics" repos (as unmodifiable backup and with no .git history) but I'll start leaving the original development repos undeleted at my account as well... with all .git commit and other git objects history available in them.
